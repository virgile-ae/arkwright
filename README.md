# Features of the language

- Mutable and (almost) immutable assignement with `let` and `const` (and reassignment through `set`).
- Input and output through `input` and `print` (access the DOM in the browser should also work but hasn't been tested).
- Functions can be created through `func`.
- Boolean expressions are available through `and`, `or`, and `not`.
- Comparison and arithmetic operators (`=`, `!=`, `>=`, `>`, `<=`, `<`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
