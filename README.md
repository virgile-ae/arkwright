# Features of the language

- Strings e.g. `"hello, world"`, numbers e.g. `-123.1`, booleans (`true` and `false`) and a null/nil value (`nil`),
- Mutable and (almost) immutable assignment with `let` and `const` (and soon reassignment through `set`).
- Comments, prefixed with `//`.
- Input and output through `input` and `print` (access to the DOM in the browser should also work but hasn't been tested).
- Functions can be created through `func`.
- Boolean expressions are available through `and`, `or`, and `not`.
- Comparison and arithmetic operators (`=`, `!=`, `>=`, `>`, `<=`, `<`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- Expressions can be chained through `do`.
- Lists with `[` and `]` and indexing through `nth`.
- Conditional branching through `if` expressions.
- Access to the javascript ecosystem (you can use `require` for imports).
